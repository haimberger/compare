# compare

Package `compare` provides customizable functionality for comparing values.

## Development

Before committing any changes, make sure to run

    make lint

It will concurrently run a bunch of linters including [go vet](https://golang.org/cmd/vet/) and [megacheck](https://github.com/dominikh/go-tools/tree/master/cmd/megacheck).

You can also run linters for individual packages:

    make basic.lint // run linters in basic package

## Testing

The following command runs all tests in all packages:

    make test

If you'd like to see the test coverage information in a more visually appealing form, you can try the following:

    make test-coverage

It will save the coverage information to a file, then open a browser window showing the covered (green), uncovered (red), and uninstrumented (grey) source. You can find more information under "Viewing the results" [here](https://blog.golang.org/cover).

If you only want to run tests for one package, there are commands for that as well:

    make basic.test  # run tests in basic package
    make basic.cov   # show coverage information for basic package
